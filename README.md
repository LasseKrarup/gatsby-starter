# Gatsby Starter with TailwindCSS and NetlifyCMS

This is a Gatsby Starter created by [Lasse Krarup](https://github.com/LasseKrarup).
It uses TailwindCSS and NetlifyCMS and includes an example of how to generate pages programatically.

It is based on the [Default Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

It uses [yarn as a package manager](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/yarn/). 

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this TailwindCSS/NetlifyCMS starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LasseKrarup/gatsby-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd project-name/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `project-name` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this particular Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json

    ├── README.md
    ├── tailwind.config.js
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/content`**: This directory will contain content generated by NetlifyCMS. You can change the path to your liking, but be sure to match this path in `/static/admin/config.yml`

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
4.  **`/static`**: This directory will contain static assets such as your `/static/admin/config.yml` file to configure NetlifyCMS. It will also, by default, include assets uploaded through NetlifyCMS (configured in `/static/admin/config.yml`).

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

9.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

10. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

11. **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13. **`postcss.config.js`**: Config-file for PostCSS. This starter uses TailwindCSS with PostCSS. You can leave this file as it is, if you don't want to configure PostCSS additionally

14. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

15. **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration file for TailwindCSS. See https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration for more info on how to configure TailwindCSS

16. **`yarn.lock`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
